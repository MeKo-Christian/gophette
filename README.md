# Build

Make sure you have the [SDL2 Go wrapper](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) installed.

To install under OS X you can do this:

    brew install sdl2
    brew install sdl2_ttf
    brew install --with-libvorbis sdl2_mixer
    brew install sdl2_image
    go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl
    go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl_image
    go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl_mixer
    go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl_ttf

You need to have a C compiler installed for that so if you are on Windows you need [MinGW](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/) installed as well.

After installing these you should be able to go get it:

    go get github.com/gophergala2016/gophette

and be ready to play.
